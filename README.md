Guessing the random number game using PIC18F4580
EE366 is considered a fundamental course within the curriculum of electrical engineering, as it covers topics related to microcontrollers. In this course, the PIC18F4580 from MICROCHIP was studied. 
In this project, we programmed the microcontroller to generate a random number at the beginning, and the user had to guess this number. Additionally, a sound recording module was added to inform the user whether the answer was correct or incorrect. The project was presented on a manually crafted PCB (Printed Circuit Board).
